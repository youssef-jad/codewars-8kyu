## codeWars kyu Challenges [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/youssef-jad/codewars-kata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/youssef-jad/codewars-kata)

#### First Challenge : 
Instructions : 

```In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.

Our function will take three parameters:

last - The Date object with the date of the last period

today - The Date object with the date of the check

cycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days

If the today is later from last than the cycleLength, the function should return true. We consider it to be late if the number of passed days is larger than the cycleLength. Otherwise return false.
```

#### 2nd Challenge : 
link https://www.codewars.com/kata/exes-and-ohs 

**Instructions :** 

```
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's.
The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. 
The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:
XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false

```
